AddResourceRole and RemoveResourceRole delegates

The 
AddResourceRole
 and 
RemoveResourceRole
 delegate respectively adds and removes the user as the member with the role to the resource. Matched/removed member is returned with output variable.

Field name

Mandatory

Description

resourceId

Y

Id of the resource for the member.

roleId

Y

Identify the member role - either id or name must be set, setting both will cause id to be used.

roleName

userId

Y

Identify the member user - either id or name must be set, setting both will cause id to be used.

userName

resultVariableName

N

The name of the variable that the result will be set in, if not given the result will be set in the variable named "output".

The delegate is deprecated. Replace your service task containing this delegate with a script task, for example:

Add resource role:
        
<scriptTask id="scripttask1" name="Assign owner" scriptFormat="groovy" activiti:autoStoreVariables="false">
    <script><![CDATA[
        import com.collibra.dgc.core.api.dto.instance.responsibility.AddResponsibilityRequest
        def userName = execution.getVariable("startUser")
        def ownerUserId = userApi.getUserByUsername(userName).getId();           
        responsibilityApi.addResponsibility(AddResponsibilityRequest.builder()
            .resourceId(item.id)
            .resourceType(item.type)
            .roleId(string2Uuid(roleId))
            .ownerId(ownerUserId)
            .build())
    ]]></script>
</scriptTask>

Remove resource role:
			
<scriptTask id="scripttask1" name="Remove current Owner role" scriptFormat="groovy" activiti:autoStoreVariables="false">
    <script><![CDATA[
        import com.collibra.dgc.core.api.dto.instance.responsibility.FindResponsibilitiesRequest
        def ownerUserId = userApi.getUserByUsername(ownerName).getId();
        def ownerRoleId = users.getRoleId("Owner");
        def responsibilities = responsibilityApi.findResponsibilities(FindResponsibilitiesRequest.builder()
            .resourceIds(Collections.singletonList(domain.id))
            .ownerIds(Collections.singletonList(ownerUserId))
            .roleIds(Collections.singletonList(ownerRoleId))
            .build())
         .getResults()
        responsibilityApi.removeResponsibilities(new ArrayList(responsibilities.collect{ it.getId() }));
    ]]></script>
</scriptTask>

                AddRelation delegate
                            

                                GetTerm and RemoveTerm delegate
