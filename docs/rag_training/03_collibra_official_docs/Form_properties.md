Form properties

December 9, 2025

A form property is a configuration element used to define input fields or variables for start events and user tasks. While the Workflow Designer supports form properties for backwards compatibility, use 
form references
 when designing user tasks. Form references offer enhanced configuration options.

The behavior of a form property is determined by the 
Readable
 parameter:

Readable

Behavior

Clear (recommended)

Creates a 
configuration variable
 that you can later edit on the 
workflow definition page
 in Collibra.

Selected (not recommended)

Creates an individual input element that is part of a 
dialog box
 presented to the user before the workflow starts.

Form property parameters

Form property parameters determine the value and class of the stored value for configuration variables. If used in a start form or user task (not recommended), they also determines the type of input that appears in the dialog box or task sidebar.

Parameter

Description

Id (required)

The unique ID of the form property. This is also the name of the workflow variable that contains the user-submitted value.

IDs cannot include special characters.

Name (recommended)

The description of the configuration variable.

If used in a start form or user task (not recommended), the label that is displayed on the form, next to the property.

Responsibilities (required)

The 
form property type
.

Expression (not used for configuration variables)

Use an expression to show a value for this form.
${1 > 2}
 shows "False" for a Boolean.
You must clear the 
Writable
 parameter.
The class of the stored value for the expression result must match that of the property.
The form variable does not retain the shown value.

Variable (not used for configuration variables)

Use a variable to show the value of that variable.

If you select the 
Writable
 parameter, the user can change the value of the variable.

variableName
 for a Boolean variable that has the value 
false
 shows "False". If the user selects 
True
 for this property, the value of 
variableName
 updates to 
true
.

The class of the stored value for the variable must match that of the property.

Default (mandatory for configuration variables)

The default value for the property.

You can also use variables, such as 
${variableName}
 or expressions, such as 
${1 > 2}

The class of the stored value for the variable or the expression result must match that of the property.

Required

Whether it is mandatory to enter a value for the property.
Select this checkbox for configuration variables.

Readable

Whether the property is shown to the user.
Clear this checkbox for configuration variables.

Writable

Whether the user can change the current value.
