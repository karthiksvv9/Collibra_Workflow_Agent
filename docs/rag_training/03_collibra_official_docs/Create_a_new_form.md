Create a new form

There are two ways to create a new form from the Workflow Designer:

Manually from the 
Models
 tab of an app or from the 
Actions
 section of the search bar.

Design it in the process editor.

Create a form manually

 In your app, click the 
 
Create
 button → 
Form
 or use the 
Actions
 section of the search bar.

Enter the required information.
Field
Description
Name
                            
The name of the new model.
Key
A technical identifier used to refer to the process on a technical level.
Review and confirm any ramifications before updating the model key.
Description
The purpose of the model. 
Tags
A label for the model, to help categorize the model in your platform.
Adding identifying tags to your model improves your search capabilities.

Click 
Create
.

Your newly created model appears in the list of models of the app.

Create a form from the process editor

In the navigation bar, click 
Process
.

Select an existing process design or click 
Create process
 to create a new one.

Drag and drop a 
User task
 from the palette to the canvas.

Select the user task on the canvas.

In the 
Details
 section of the attribute bar, click 
Form reference
 to expand the properties.

In the 
New
 tab, add a 
Name
 and a 
Key
.

Click 
Create
.

Once you create a new form, you will be redirected to the editor view where you can begin to model the form.

In the process editor, select an element in the palette on the left side of the canvas and drag it into the drawing area. The element then becomes part of your form.

If you click anywhere in the drawing area, you can change certain attributes from the attribute bar, on the right side of the canvas.

Select a specific field to change its attributes.

Click the whitespace surrounding the diagram elements to modify the attributes of the entire model.

When you select one of the components on the canvas, you gain access to additional quick actions, such as editing the label or the value, replacing the component, cutting, copying, or deleting the component.
