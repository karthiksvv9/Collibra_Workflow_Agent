AddAttribute delegate

The AddAttribute delegate adds an attribute and returns the added one with the output variable.

Field name

Mandatory

Description

value

Y

String representation of the value of an attribute, in case it's multi list separate values with the sign specified in multilistSeparator parameter. In case of boolean attribute use "true" or "false".

ownerId

Y

ID of the term that the attribute will be added for.

typeId

Y

Identify type term for the attribute - either id or signifier must be set, setting both will cause typeId to be used.

typeSignifier

multilistSeparator

N

The separator for multilist attribute value. By default comma will be used, if you want to customize it specify your own.

resultVariableName

N

The name of the variable that the result will be set in, if not given the result will be set in the variable named "output"

The delegate is deprecated. Replace your service task containing this delegate with a script task, for example:
<scriptTask id="scripttask1" name="Add attribute" scriptFormat="groovy" activiti:autoStoreVariables="false">
    <script><![CDATA[
        import com.collibra.dgc.core.api.dto.instance.attribute.AddAttributeRequest;
        def attribute = attributeApi.addAttribute(AddAttributeRequest.builder()
            .assetId(item.id)
            .typeId(string2Uuid(givenAttributeTypeId)))
            .value("attribute content")
            .build())
        execution.setVariable("output", attribute)
    ]]></script>
</scriptTask>

                GetAttribute and RemoveAttribute delegates
                            

                                TermIntake delegate
